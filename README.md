# Final project for CS-498 (Data Visualization)

With my data visualisation I address some aspects concerning the debate around the federal minimum wage in the United States. This debate has gained recent traction since the “Raise the Wage” bill was passed in Congress on July 18, 2019.

I used the “Interactive Slide Show” narrative structure to retain more author control over the messaging while allowing the reader to interact with the data presented. The presentation consists of 5 slides that can be viewed by the user in any order by clicking on the pagination navigation at the top of the slide.

To ensure consistent visual structure, each slide is built from a template that consists of a headline summarising the nature of the data, a text to introduce the issue, and a line chart with one or more elements illustrating the data in question. Annotations within the chart highlight points made in the text and tooltips allow the reader to drill down into additional information within the context of the chart. The text and data in each slide lead prepare the reader thematically and contextually for the content of the next slide.

I used the following scenes in my visualisation, in the following navigational order:

1. History of federal minimum wage in the United States
2. Value of $15 since inception of "Fight for 15" movement
3. Falling buying power of federal minimum wage
4. Federal Minimum Wage and the Poverty Threshold
5. COLA: Cost of Living Adjustment on Senate Salaries

The overall development as the reader advances to each following slide starts with the context of the federal minimum wage in U.S. history before delving more deeply into the value of the minimum wage and what that means to the people who earn a minimum wage. The final slide addresses the relationship between historical raises in minimum wage and the automatic adjustments in salary for those who get a say on approving - or rejecting - such increases.

I used a template for annotations in order to give visual consistency to the highlighted points in the data. Each slide has 1 to 2 annotations, and each annotation is titled with a year or years of the data it is highlighting. Annotations were used to make visual a point that was made in the text.

The parameters of my visualisation are simple: years and money. The years displayed remain mostly the same from chart to chart with the exception of a zoom-like focus on the value of $15 for the specific years of 2012 to 2015 on chart 2, and for the starting year of 1959 for displaying the historical development of the poverty threshold on slide 4, as data is only available starting with that year. Money was either a parameter of U.S. dollars per hour, U.S. dollars per year, or as a measure of worth, as in slide 3 where the buying power of the minimum wage over history is visualised.

Triggers that changed the state of the visualisation included navigation buttons to select slides, and tooltips that brought up more information about a specific selected datapoint when the reader hovered over a section of the chart with the mouse. The reader is alerted to the availability of tooltips in a light-grey text above each slide, as part of the template, and by the appearance of tooltips as soon as the reader enters the graphic with mouse.
